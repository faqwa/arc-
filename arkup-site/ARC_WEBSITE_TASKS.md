# Arc^ Website Discovery Notes & Task Plan (Astro)

## Vision Highlights (from client conversation)
- **Emotional entry**: Home page must spark curiosity, invite reflection, and politely repel misaligned visitors.
- **Primary audience**: STEM-aligned students (engineers, chemists, physicists, technologists, etc.) who can champion projects within academic settings and collaborate under Arc^ licensing terms.
- **Engagement arc**: Narrative/context-first experience in Astro → deeper project/docs space once alignment and curiosity are established; documentation platform decision still open.
- **Transparency**: High openness about work-in-progress, task boards, and experiment status; encourages parallel investigations even when core team is at capacity.
- **Safety stance**: Dual-layer approach—formal risk assessments for trained practitioners plus accessible safety guidance for hobbyists/DIY audiences, with reminders to respect local laws/jurisdictional limits.
- **Brand essence**: Arc^ as “restorative bridging technology” — destructive of pollutants yet healing; design should feel bold, regenerative, balanced, and accessible (dark landing page with plasma-inspired motion on radar, but visuals may shift per project context: saltwater, wastewater, pollution cues).
- **Community touchpoints**: Discord for coordination, YouTube for prototypes + educational content, email + forms for onboarding; licensing must enforce share-alike / non-extractive ethos.
- **Geographic context**: Global initiative rooted in Australia; opportunity for future stakeholder/funder page with Australian focus.

## Updated Task Clusters

### 1. Experience Strategy
- Articulate the desired emotional journey (curiosity → resonance → action) and how each main page supports it.
- Define guardrails for messaging that signals alignment requirements early without feeling exclusionary.

### 2. Audience Activation
- Craft student-focused value proposition: how Arc^ supports honours/PhD projects and institutional collaboration.
- Map pathways for different disciplines (hardware, molecular science, ethics/philosophy) to find relevant entry points.
- Plan licensing explainer that addresses data/IP sharing expectations with universities and supervisors (legal clauses TBD).

### 3. Narrative Flow & Information Architecture
- Design Astro site structure delivering framework, principles, roadmaps, and project bubbles before handing off to deeper documentation.
- Capture tech decision note: documentation platform undecided (Astro-native vs Docusaurus); revisit once project teams form.
- Outline cross-page navigation (nav, contextual CTAs, page-end trails) supporting guided exploration.

### 4. Visual & Interaction Concepts
- Explore hero concepts for dark-mode landing page with plasma-inspired or project-specific environmental visuals (non-thermal plasma, saltwater, wastewater, pollution cues).
- Establish visual balance to express “destructive yet restorative” technology (palette, motion cues, imagery mix).

### 5. Safety Communication System
- Create pattern for dual safety messaging: accessible warnings + linked formal risk assessment documents per project/protocol (template to be designed later).
- Define compliance reminders regarding local regulations and disclaimers of liability.

### 6. Transparency & Project Tracking
- Design public task board / progress update system; integrate with GitHub Projects if feasible, fallback to manually curated update blocks per project.
- Determine how to showcase experiment lifecycle (prototype build, testing, analysis, conclusions) while staying digestible.

### 7. Community & Onboarding
- Plan entry points for Discord, YouTube, email, and structured contact form (with selectable interest areas) to streamline follow-up.
- Outline onboarding content (background primers, prototype walkthroughs, commitment levels) and where it lives.

### 8. Accessibility & Inclusivity
- Set accessibility goals (contrast, motion controls, screen-reader cues, clear language) for the MVP.
- Note future multilingual considerations; confirm initial language remains English.

### 9. Stakeholder/Funder Angle (Future)
- Capture requirements for an Australia-focused stakeholder/funder page when funding conversations begin.

### 10. MVP Definition
- Identify minimum set of pages/components to ship first (e.g., Landing, Framework, Projects overview, Safety primer, Contact/Join).
- Prioritize which community touchpoints (Discord, YouTube, contact form) must be live at MVP vs later.

## Outstanding Questions & Follow-ups
1. **Hero animation direction**: Do you want us to concept multiple plasma/environment variants for testing, or should we focus on one universal motion treatment first?
2. **Risk assessment assets**: When you’re ready, should we create both the formal template and the citizen-friendly summary from scratch, or will you supply draft content to adapt?
3. **Task board integration**: If we embed GitHub Projects later, do you envision the public seeing raw cards/tasks, or would you prefer a curated read-only view summarizing highlights?
4. **Institutional info pack**: For the student contact form, would a downloadable starter packet (PDF/MDX) be helpful to send supervisors the key licensing/expectations upfront?
5. **Licensing language**: Until formal legal docs exist, are you comfortable with plain-language commitments plus a clear notice that detailed terms are in development?

(Share any additional direction or clarifications before we move into MVP structuring tasks.)
