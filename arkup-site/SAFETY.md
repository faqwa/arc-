# SAFETY FIRST — READ BEFORE CONTRIBUTING

**DO NOT** attempt any high-voltage, chemical, or biological experiments using this repository. This repo currently contains *no operational protocols or hardware* — only scaffolding and templates.

When operational content is added in the future, every protocol must include:
- frontmatter safety_summary
- explicit PPE and hazard info
- an incident reporting flow

Minimum: if you are not trained in electrical or chemical safety, do not attempt builds. If in doubt, do not proceed.
