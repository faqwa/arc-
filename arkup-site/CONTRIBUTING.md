# Contributing to ARKUP

Thanks for your interest. Minimum rules:

1. Read SAFETY.md before adding anything related to experiments/hardware.
2. Use docs/templates/protocol_template.md for protocol drafts.
3. Create a branch eature/<short-desc> and open PRs against main.
4. Include required frontmatter for any doc: title, status, version, date, license, safety_summary.
5. Safety-critical PRs (hardware, protocols) must list a reviewer with relevant expertise.

See .github/ for PR and issue templates (add when needed).
